# Grove Examples #

Presented here are various examples demonstrating the use cases of [Grove](https://github.com/zivia/grove).

## ARGoS Simulator - Foraging with the CPFA ##

[ARGoS](http://www.argos-sim.info/) is a "multi-physics robot simulator" that we will utilize in tandem with the [CPFA (Central Place Foraging Algorithm)](https://github.com/BCLab-UNM/CPFA-ARGoS) to evolve interesting foraging behaviors in robotic ant swarms. 

For a comprehensive explanation of this example, see the [relevant documentation]().

## GESwarm - Recreating a Generic CPFA ##

[GESwarm](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2463385) is a concrete use case of grammatical evolution. It uses a formal grammar to specify the set of all possible rules that dictate the collective behaviors manifested in a simulation. Derivations of the grammar are then evolved, which correlate directly with state machines used by the simulator. For this example, we will use an incredibly simple 2D simulator included with Grove.
