## Swarms - Foraging Task with GESwarm ##

[GESwarm](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2463385) is a concrete use case of grammatical evolution. It uses a formal grammar to specify the set of all possible rules that dictate the collective behaviors manifested in a simulation. Derivations of the grammar are then evolved, which correlate directly with state machines used by the simulator. For this example, we will use an incredibly simple 2D simulator included with Grove.
